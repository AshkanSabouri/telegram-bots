# Telegram Bots

This repository is a collection of Telegram bots I've developed using Python and the `python-telegram-bot` library (and other tools when needed). Each bot serves a different purpose, ranging from automation and moderation to fun and utilities.

## 📁 Contents

Each folder in this repository represents a separate bot. Inside each folder, you'll typically find:
- Source code (`.py` files)
- Configuration files
- A `README.md` with setup and usage instructions specific to the bot

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- python-telegram-bot
- Requests / aiohttp
- SQLite / MySQL (for persistent storage when needed)
- Other third-party APIs depending on bot features

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run a bot:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/telegram-bots.git
   cd telegram-bots/"targetbot"
   python main.py
